Website Remakes is a website that lists all of the remakes I've made.
The purpose is to have fun redesigning the website I used to visit all the time or the websites I've visited and thinking how amazing it looks and features.

This side project is mainly used for improving my website making skills and improve my ability to take an idea from another website, and implement it into my own website.

If you're someone other than me, have fun looking through the code and finding the solutions for your problem. Whether that will be an animation,
feature, code, implementation, or any other. I'm happy to be of help to anyone.
